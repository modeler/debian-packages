Description: DVD and Blu-ray to MKV Converter and Network Streamer
 MakeMKV is your one-click solution to convert video that you own into free and
 patents-unencumbered format that can be played everywhere. MakeMKV is a format
 converter, otherwise called "transcoder". It converts the video clips from
 proprietary (and usually encrypted) disc into a set of MKV files, preserving
 most information but not changing it in any way. The MKV format can store
 multiple video/audio tracks with all meta-information and preserve chapters.
 There are many players that can play MKV files nearly on all platforms, and
 there are tools to convert MKV files to many formats, including DVD and
 Blu-ray discs.
