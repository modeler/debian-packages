Description: Cross-cruncher that runs on Win32, DOS or Linux
 Exomizer is a program that compresses files in a way that tries to be as
 efficient as possible but still allows them to be decompressed in environments
 where CPU speed and RAM are limited. For some popular 8-bit computers using
 6502 compatible CPUs it can also generate executable files that decompress
 themselves in memory when run.
